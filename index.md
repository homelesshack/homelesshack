## Interested in homelessness? Wondering about getting involved? Why not try this?

If you get involved just to find out more about [homelessness](https://www.manchesterdigital.com/events/homelesshack) that would be great. If you would like to do more it doesn't really matter how much time you can spare or what skills and experience you can offer - there will be a team that would love to have your support and encouragement and you will probably learn something new.

There are conversations going on in social media and [#homelesshack in twitter](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23homelesshack) has become a kind of community notice board to share information and ask for help.

[Events](#event-details) are fun, motivating and a great way to get a lot of information in a short space of time. [Events](#event-details) are being organised around the country and it would be great to see more of different shapes and sizes in more places.

Small groups are organising events or trying out new ideas. We have provided [links](#useful-links) to most of these. If you are not sure how to help feel free to contact the team directly.
